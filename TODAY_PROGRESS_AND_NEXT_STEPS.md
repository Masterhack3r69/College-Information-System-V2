# SIS Project Handoff: Progress and Next Steps

Date: 2026-07-09

This document summarizes what was accomplished today in the Student Information System backend and what should be implemented next. It is intended as a handoff for a new Codex/chat session so the next agent can continue without needing the full prior conversation.

## Current Project State

The repository is a Spring Boot backend for a college Student Information System.

Tech stack currently in use:

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.3.7
- Maven
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
- Spring Security with JWT
- PostgreSQL 16
- Flyway
- Docker Compose
- PDFBox and Spring Mail dependencies are present for later report/email work

Current branch:

- `master`

Latest commit:

- `c70c71d Add curriculum and student profile modules`

Default seeded admin account:

```text
username: admin
password: admin123
email: admin@sis.local
```

Run locally:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Verify:

```powershell
mvn test
```

## Completed Today

### 1. Foundation Already Present

The backend has a working foundation:

- Maven Spring Boot application.

### Next Module 2: Frontend Workflows

Build after backend workflows are stable.

Recommended first reports:

- Registrar workflows for students, curriculum, schedules, enrollment, grades, and reports.
- Cashier workflows for fee setup and assessment.
- Faculty workflows for class lists and grade encoding.

## Current Known Limitations

- No frontend has been built yet.
- Audit payloads intentionally omit passwords, tokens, and uploaded file contents.
- Document storage is local filesystem only.
- Redis is present in Docker Compose but not meaningfully used yet.
- No hard-delete workflows are implemented for academic records.
- No student portal behavior yet, only backend roles/permissions.

## Suggested First Prompt For New Chat

Use this prompt in a new chat:

```text
We are building a Spring Boot 3 / Java 21 Student Information System backend in C:\Users\Technical Support\Documents\GitHub\cis.

Please read TODAY_PROGRESS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md and README.md first.

Current completed modules:
- Auth/JWT/RBAC
- Academic setup
- Curriculum management
- Student profile management
- Schedule management and conflict checking
- Enrollment management
- Fees and assessment
- Grade recording and academic records
- Reports and PDFs

Next task:
Build the first frontend workflow for registrar users, then faculty, cashier, and Super Admin workflows.

Please create a plan first if we are in Plan Mode, otherwise implement it directly, run mvn test, restart the backend, and manually verify the audit events.
```
